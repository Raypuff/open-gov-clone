# Open Government Products Website Clone

A website built for fun! This is in no way meant to represent any organization - It is just a personal project that I started because I found the website design really modern and impressive. The site is currently deployed at https://open-gov-clone.vercel.app/

## Getting started
1. Install a stable version of NodeJS.
2. Clone this repository.
3. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
4. Run `npm run dev` to start the dev server at `localhost:3000`.

## Static Code Analysis
This project is configured with ESLint and Prettier. You may also run `npm lint` to check for any style violations.

## Acknowledgements
- The website is deployed at Vercel
- The following libraries were used:
  - Create Next App
  - Typescript
  - Tailwind CSS
  - React Icons
